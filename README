Based on blog post https://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/creating-a-man-page-with-distutils-and-optparse/
Latest original version (2017) https://github.com/andialbrecht/build_manpage

This version works with argparse instead of optparse like the original 
and doesn't require a separate step to build/install the man page

Look at setup.cfg and setup.py to see what you need to add to those files.

It looks in setup.py to find information like authors &c. Look at build_manpage.py for details.
